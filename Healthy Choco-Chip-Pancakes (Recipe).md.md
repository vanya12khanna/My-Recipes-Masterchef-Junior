                          THE RECIPE-:

Step 1: Take 1 + 1/2 cups of milk in a bowl.
Step 2: To this add 1 tbsp of white vinegar and mix it all up. Then, set it aside for 5 minutes.
Step 3: In another bowl add 1 + 3/4 cup of flour, 1 tsp of baking powder, 1/2 tsp of baking soda, 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and 1/4 cup of any type of sweetner, like- coconut sugar, white sugar, jaggery powder, brown sugar, etc. and mix all of the dry ingredients together.
Step 4: To the dry ingredients, add a few choco-chips and the mixture of milk and vinegar that we had left to set earlier.
Step 5: To this, add 1/3 cup hot water and 1/4 cup of vegetable oil. You can also use melted butter instead of vegetable oil.
Step 6: Mix up this final pancake batter using a spoon. 
Step 7: Now, take a non-stick pan, put it on low flame and brush it with vegetable oil/butter.
Step 8: Once your pan is hot, take about 1/4 cup of the batter and pour it on the hot pan. Let the batter spread on it's own, and if it doesn't then spread it using a spoon.
Step 9: Let the pancake cook for a couple of minutes on low heat and don't increase the heat otherwise you'll burn them.
Step 10: When you start seeing some air bubbles on the surface, that's when you know that you need to fip your pancakes very carefully and then cook it on the other side for another couple of minutes.
Step 11: Repeat these steps (Step 8-10) with the rest of the batter from which you can make about 10 pancakes if the size of the pancakes is medium. 

If you wish, you may add chocolate sauce on top of the pancakes to make them tastier.
